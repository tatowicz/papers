Implement papers and models in AI to learn. 

## Goals 
* Write various ideas presented in papers and importance
* Attach papers from library 
* Write perfs 
* Various papers ML/AI papers implemented using pytorch 
* MPS device for apple silicon speed ups
* Various pytorch examples for learning
* Gym env and standard dataset eval



## Models
* Example Onnx save, run `torch_quickstart.py` 
* Open .onnx file to view sample model with Netron --> https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron

[1] DQN_paper.py: from 2013 DQN paper, tested using cartpole gym   
[2] DQN_experiment.py: Expierments with DQN    
[3] transformer_paper.py: the 2017 transformer 


## Stucture
  `weights/` - Weights download directory for models  
  `data/` - Data download directory for training and test data  
  `samples/` - Random experiments and examples  
  `papers/` - Will eventually add pdf papers
